## Inspiration
We've always found trouble securing date locations. Making choices is too difficult when you have so many options in your face. Imagine you want to travel to Japan one day. What decisions will you make in terms of activities or restaurants? Plan-it allows you to explore the world and discover activities and local businesses you would not have discovered on your own. With customizable preferences, you can find something to do with the click of a finger!

## What it does
Plan-it lets both the users looking for date spots and local businesses looking to promote themselves create profiles. The users can request to have a date at the local business and the business can decide whether to fulfill the request.

## How we built it
We created a full-stack application with the front-end being Next.js and the Backend being Node.js

## Challenges we ran into
3/4 Members were completely new to app development and it was our first time hosting the website on Vercel and using mongo DB. A ton of debugging was necessary to get the initial local website to load.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting the website to even load as out team consists of beginners in terms of web app design.

## What we learned
We learned it was necessary to keep up communication and build a solid starting grounds in terms of software architect. This solid ground will let us build this app futher in the future.

## What's next for Plan-it: For your next successful date
We plan to refine the software for Plan-It and finish features such as saving log-in and confirming reservations from the business side. We plan to also create a business plan and apply to startup accelerators like Y-Combinator as we believe in the potential of this business and the travel & dating market.
